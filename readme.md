This is the milestone 5 of my hackathon project, where I have created a section for a resume link. Here, users can enter their name and generate a personalized link with their name. Not only that, when the resume is generated, it will create a unique link, and if the user clicks on it, they can download the resume. The downloaded resume will be saved in your storage, so you can view it from there as well and share it with anyone you like.

I hope you liked this hackathon project, and I hope you had a great experience!
